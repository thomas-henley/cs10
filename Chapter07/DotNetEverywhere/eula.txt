SCHEDULE A TO THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL (OR ALTERNATIVE) TERMS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIES.

1.    Orders and Payment

1.1. Customer may order Licensed Products and/or Support Services by submitting to PTC (directly or through a Reseller) a completed Quote and such other order documentation as is required by PTC. Each order for Licensed Products accepted by PTC shall be deemed to be separate and distinct from any order by Customer for Support Services. CUSTOMER MAY NOT CANCEL AN ORDER ONCE PTC HAS ACCEPTED IT. Other than the line items that serve to order Licensed Product(s) and/or Support Services, in no event shall any other terms of any Customer purchase order modify this Agreement or become binding on PTC.

1.2. Customer shall be obligated to pay the applicable fees for the Licensed Products and/or Support Services ordered. All fees and other charges due hereunder are due and payable in full within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, or later if specified on the Quote and/or the invoice.  For renewals, PTC will typically invoice the Customer prior to the renewal date but the renewal fee will not be owed until the renewal date. Customer shall be responsible for all sales, use, VAT, transfer and other taxes and duties imposed by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental authority relating to the Licenses granted or the Support Services provided hereunder, exclusive, however, of taxes based on the net income of PTC.  Customer shall pay interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month (or, if less, the maximum amount permitted by law) on all sums due under this Agreement which remain unpaid thirty (30) days after due, such interest to commence on the due date.  Customer shall pay PTC's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by PTC in collecting overdue amounts, and/or in any controversy or litigation arising under or in connection with the Licensed Products and/or this Agreement in which Customer does not prevail against PTC in all of the claims.

2. License

2.1. License Grant. Upon PTC's acceptance of an order for Licensed Products, PTC grants to Customer a License to install and use the Licensed Products identified in the Quote during the applicable License Term, solely for Customer's internal business purposes and solely in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable usage and license-type restrictions identified in the Quote and the Licensing Basis Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Licensed Product is being provided by PTC on an "evaluation" or "trial" basis, such License will be instead to install and use the Licensed Product solely to evaluate such Licensed Products, and Customer agrees not to use the Licensed Product in any commercial applications or for productive purposes. Also, if the Licensed Product is sold on a "demo and test" or "non-production" basis (or similar designation), such Licensed Product may not be used in a production environment.

2.2. Designated Country/Servers. Except in the case of Global or Restricted Global Licenses, Customer may only install and operate Licensed Products on the applicable Designated Server situated in the applicable Designated Country. Customer may, from time to time, change the Designated Server and/or the Designated Country in which Customer seeks to install or operate a Licensed Product, provided that in each case (i) Customer shall give prior written notice to PTC of any such change, and (ii) upon moving the Licensed Products to a different Designated Country, Customer shall pay the associated Uplift Fees.

2.3. Additional Restrictions on Use. Customer shall not permit any persons who are not Permitted Users to access or use the Licensed Products. As a condition of the grant of license set forth in Section 2.1, Customer shall not and shall not permit any third party(ies) to:

(i) modify or create any derivative work of any part of the Licensed Products;

(ii) rent, lease, or loan the Licensed Products;

(iii) use the Licensed Products, or permit them to be used, for third-party training, to deliver software implementation or consulting services to any third parties, or for commercial time-sharing or service bureau use;

(iv) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Licensed Products or the file format of the Licensed Products, or otherwise attempt to gain access to the source code or file format of the Licensed Products, except as expressly permitted in Schedule A, if applicable;

(v) sell, license, sublicense, loan, assign, or otherwise transfer (whether by sale, exchange, gift, operation of law, or otherwise) to any third party the Licensed Products, any copy thereof, or any License or other rights thereto, in whole or in part, without in each case obtaining PTC's prior written consent, except to the extent that any of the foregoing are explicitly authorized in the Quote and/or the Licensing Basis Document;

(vi) alter, remove, or obscure any copyright, trade secret, patent, trademark, logo, proprietary and/or other legal notices on or in any copies of the Licensed Products; and

(vii) copy or otherwise reproduce the Licensed Products in whole or in part, except (a) as may be required for their installation into computer memory for the purpose of executing the Licensed Products in accordance with this Section 2, and/or (b) to make a reasonable number of copies solely for back-up purposes (provided that any such permitted copies shall be the property of PTC and Customer shall reproduce thereon all PTC copyright, trade secret, patent, trademark, logo, proprietary and/or other legal notices contained in the original copy of the Licensed Product obtained from PTC).

2.4.  Restriction on Installation Location.  Except for "Global" licenses (as specified in the product name), all of PTC's products are restricted such that they may only be installed in the Designated Country.  Where Customer desires to change the country of installation, Customer is required to notify PTC and, where the list prices for such licenses are higher in the proposed new country of installation, uplift fees are required based on the difference.

2.5. Restrictions on User Location (Concurrent User Products).  Except for "Global" and "Restricted Global" licenses, PTC products that are licensed on a Concurrent User basis may only be used by persons physically located in the country where the products are installed, and all of the software components shipped as part of that product (for example, client code and license server) may only be installed in the Designated Country.  However, where a person who is normally located in that country is traveling abroad, that person can check out the license for a limited period of time (for most products two weeks), during which time period such license is not available on Customer's network.  Users who are not employees of the Customer may use PTC products licensed on a Concurrent User basis only while physically located at a Customer site.  THE RESTRICTIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH APPLY ONLY TO CONCURRENT USER PRODUCTS, NOT TO PTC PRODUCTS THAT ARE LICENSED ON A DIFFERENT BASIS THAN CONCURRENT USER.

2.6. Global/Restricted Global Licenses. A "Global" License allows the Customer to install, operate and use such Licensed Product at any of the Customer's site(s) throughout the world, notwithstanding any restrictions in the License Agreement in relation to limiting use of Licensed Products to the country of installation, but subject to compliance with all applicable export laws and regulations.  A "Restricted Global" License allows the Customer to install, operate and use such Licensed Product at any of the Customer's site(s) located in the Designated Country and/or in any Permitted Country, notwithstanding any restrictions in the License Agreement in relation to limiting use of Licensed Products to the country of installation.  "Permitted Countries" means China, India, Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Malaysia, South Africa, Israel, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Romania.

2.7. Third Party Components and Bundled Third Party Products. Certain of the Licensed Products may contain embedded third party software components for which additional terms apply.  The current additional terms are set forth on the Schedule of Third Party Terms available on the Licensing Documents Webpage.

2.8. Additional Restriction(s). Additional product-specific provision(s) and terms applicable to third party components included in or with the Licensed Products may apply to particular Licensed Products, as specified in the Licensing Basis Document, which is hereby incorporated by reference.

3. Support

3.1. Support Services Plan; Levels of Support Services. Upon PTC's acceptance of Customer's order for a subscription License or for Support Services in respect of the Licensed Products, PTC and/or its authorized subcontractors shall provide Support Services in accordance with these terms for a time period of twelve (12) months or for such other period specified in Customer's order accepted by PTC (a "Support Services Plan"). The current levels of Support Services offered and Support terms are available at https://www.ptc.com/en/documents/legal-agreements/support-documents.

3.2. If Customer at any time discontinues Support Services for perpetual licenses, Customer will not be entitled to reactivate Support Services.  In such case, Customer may either use the Licensed Products without Support Services or purchase new subscription licenses.

3.3. If Customer elects Support Services for a particular Licensed Product, all of Customer's licenses of such Licensed Product must be on Support Services (i.e., partial Support orders or partial renewals are not permitted).

4. Compliance

4.1. License Usage Assessments. To confirm Customer's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer agrees that PTC and PTC's authorized agents may perform usage assessments with respect to Customer's use of the Licensed Products. Customer agrees to provide PTC access to Customer's facilities and computer systems, and cooperation from Customer's employees and consultants, as reasonably requested by PTC in order to perform such assessments, all during normal business hours, and after reasonable prior notice from PTC.

4.2. Reports. Upon written request from PTC, Customer agrees to provide to PTC an installation and/or usage report with respect to the Licensed Products (and in the case of Registered User Products, as specified in the Licensing Basis Document, such report shall include a list of all individuals for whom Customer has issued a password or other unique identifier to enable such individual to use the Registered User Product). Each such report shall be certified by an authorized representative of Customer as to its accuracy within ten (10) business days after receipt of PTC's written request. For any period in which Customer's use of the Licensed Products exceeds the number and/or the scope of the Licenses in effect during such period for such Licensed Products, Customer agrees to pay for any such excess usage, including applicable license and Support Services fees, and without limiting any other rights or remedies to which it is entitled, failure to pay shall be grounds for termination in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof.

5. Intellectual Property

PTC and its licensors are the sole owners of the Licensed Products and of any copies of the Licensed Products, and of all copyright, trade secret, patent, trademark and other intellectual or industrial property rights in and to the Licensed Products. All copies of the Licensed Products, in whatever form provided by PTC or made by Customer, shall remain the property of PTC, and such copies shall be deemed to be on loan to Customer during the License Term. Customer acknowledges that the License granted hereunder does not provide Customer with title to or ownership of the Licensed Products or any copies thereof, but only a right of limited use consistent with the express terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Customer shall have no rights to the source code for the Licensed Products and Customer agrees that only PTC shall have the right to maintain, enhance, or otherwise modify the Licensed Products.

6. Warranty; Disclaimer of Warranties

See Schedule A for a modified version of this Section 6 for Licensed Products licensed and used in Germany, Austria or Switzerland.

6.1. Warranty.  PTC warrants to Customer that PTC is authorized to grant the License(s). PTC further warrants that the Licensed Products will be free from Errors during the Warranty Period.  "Warranty Period" means: (a) for perpetual software licenses, the ninety day period commencing on the date PTC makes the Licensed Product available to Customer or Customer's designee, and (b) for subscription licenses, the term of the subscription.   PTC shall have no warranty obligations hereunder with respect to any (i) Errors attributable to any modifications or customizations of the Licensed Products, (ii) Licensed Products that are provided by PTC free of charge to Customer, and/or (iii) Bundled Third Party Products (as defined in the Schedule of Third Party Terms).  PTC's issuance of a New Release will not re-start a Warranty Period that has expired.

6.2. Sole Remedy. PTC's and its licensors' entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedy for any breach by PTC of the warranty given in the second sentence of Section 6.1 above shall be, at PTC's sole discretion, either to (a) replace the Licensed Product(s) that contains the Error, or (b) use diligent efforts to repair the Error. PTC's obligations set forth in the preceding sentence shall apply only if notice of the Error is received by PTC within the Warranty Period and Customer supplies such additional information regarding the Error as PTC reasonably requests. If PTC does not replace the applicable Licensed Product(s) and/or does not repair the Error (either by providing a bug fix, a workaround or otherwise) within a reasonable time after PTC receives written notice of the Error and associated information from Customer, upon return of such Licensed Product(s) and any copies thereof, PTC will provide a refund of: the perpetual license fees paid by Customer for the Licensed Product(s) that contains the Error, and (ii) the prepaid subscription fees for the remainder of the subscription term for the Licensed Product(s) that contains the Error, in each case upon return of such Licensed Product(s) and any copies thereof.

6.3. No Additional Warranties.  No third party, including any employee, partner, distributor (including any Reseller) or agent of PTC or any of its Resellers or sales agents is authorized to give any representations, warranties or covenants greater or different than those contained in this Agreement with respect to any Licensed Products or Support Services, except as specifically set forth in a written agreement signed on behalf of Customer by an authorized officer and on behalf of PTC by its legal counsel.

6.4. Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS SECTION 6, PTC DISCLAIMS (AND CUSTOMER WAIVES) ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND/OR ANY WARRANTY THAT CUSTOMER WILL ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR RETURN ON INVESTMENT. CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY RESULTS OBTAINED FROM USING THE LICENSED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE ADEQUACY OF INDEPENDENT TESTING OF RELIABILITY, SECURITY AND ACCURACY OF ANY ITEM DESIGNED USING LICENSED PRODUCTS. PTC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OR OTHER USE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR WILL NOT CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO CUSTOMER'S DATA, COMPUTERS OR NETWORKS.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, PTC WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM ANY SECURITY INCIDENT OR DATA LOSS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF CUSTOMER HAD IMPLEMENTED A SECURITY SOLUTIONS, DEVICES OR FEATURES (INCLUDING "PATCHES," FIXES AND UPDATES) FOR THE LICENSED PRODUCTS PROVIDED OR MADE AVAILABLE BY PTC TO CUSTOMER.

7. Indemnification; Infringement

7.1. PTC's Obligation to Indemnify Customer. PTC, at its own expense, will defend any action brought against Customer based on a claim that any Licensed Product infringes a United States, European Union or Japanese patent, copyright or trademark and, at its option, will settle any such action or will pay any final judgment awarded against Customer, provided that: (a) PTC shall be notified promptly in writing by Customer of any notice of any such claim; (b) PTC shall have the sole control of the defense of any action on such claim and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise and shall bear the costs of the same (save where one or more of the exclusions in Section 7.3 applies); and (c) Customer shall cooperate fully at PTC's expense with PTC in the defense, settlement or compromise of such claim. This Section states PTC's sole and exclusive liability, and Customer's sole remedy, for any and all claims relating to infringement of any intellectual property right.

7.2. PTC's Right to Act to Prevent a Claim. If a claim described in Section 7.1 hereof occurs or, in PTC's opinion, may occur, Customer shall permit PTC, at PTC's option and expense to: (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Licensed Product; (b) modify the Licensed Product so that it becomes non-infringing without materially impairing its functionality; or (c) terminate the applicable Licenses, accept return of the applicable Licensed Products and grant Customer a credit thereon. For Licenses purchased with a perpetual License Term, such credit shall be equal to the license fees paid by Customer for such Licensed Product depreciated on a straight-line, five year basis. For Licenses purchased on a term license or subscription basis, such credit shall be equal to the prepaid license or subscription fees for the remainder of the License Term.

7.3. Exclusions from PTC's Obligation to Indemnify Customer. PTC shall have no liability to Customer under Section 7.1 hereof or otherwise to the extent that any infringement or claim thereof is based upon: (a) use of the Licensed Product in combination with equipment or software not supplied hereunder where the Licensed Product itself would not be infringing; (b) use of other than a current release of the Licensed Product(s) provided to Customer; or (c) modification of the Licensed Product by anyone other than PTC or its employees or agents.

PTC reserves the right to charge a transfer fee for any proposed assignment, transfer or sublicense of this Agreement or any Licenses purchased hereunder.

10.4. Compliance with Laws.

(i) Each party shall be responsible for its own compliance with applicable laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to the conduct of its business and this Agreement.

Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Products and related technical data and services are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States and any country in which the Licensed Products or related technical data or services are developed, received, downloaded, used, or performed.  Further, Customer understands and acknowledges that the release of software or technology to a non-U.S. person within the United States or elsewhere abroad is deemed to be an export to the non-U.S. person's home country or countries, and that the transfer of the Licensed Products or related technology to Customer's employees, affiliates, or any third party, may require a license from the United States Government and possibly other applicable authorities. Customer shall be solely responsible for determining whether Customer's use or transfer of the Licensed Products or related technology or services requires an export license or approval from U.S. or other authorities, and for securing all required authorizations.

10.5. Severability. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, and such provisions determined to be invalid shall be deemed severed from this Agreement and replaced with terms which as closely as possible approximate the intent of such invalid provisions.

10.6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the contract between PTC and Customer with respect to the subject matter hereof. No waiver, consent, modification, amendment or change of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed or otherwise expressly acknowledged by PTC and Customer.

If Customer is acquiring the Licensed Product(s) under a United States government contract, Customer agrees that Customer will include all necessary and applicable restricted rights legends on the Licensed Products to protect PTC's proprietary rights under the FAR or other similar regulations of other federal agencies.

Apart from claims for damages based on Errors that are subject to the limitation of liability as set forth in Section 8, the obligations provided for in this Section 6.1 to 6.6 shall be PTC's exclusive liability in case of warranty claims.
6.5    Customer Responsibility. The Licensed Products are intended to be used by trained professionals and are not a substitute for the exercise by Customer of professional judgement, testing, safety and utility in their use.  Customer is solely responsible for any results which were obtained by using the Licensed Products, including the adequacy of independent testing of reliability and accuracy of any item designed using Licensed Products.
6.6    Qualities (Beschaffenheit), Guarantees. Qualities of the Licensed Products stated in publications of PTC or its sales representatives, in particular in advertising, in drawings, brochures or other documents, including presentations in the Internet, or on packaging and labeling of the Licensed Products, or which fall under trade usages, shall only be deemed to be covered by the contractual quality of the Licensed Products if such qualities are expressly contained in an offer or an order confirmation in writing.  Guarantees, in particular guarantees as to quality, shall be binding on PTC only to the extent to which they (i) are contained in an offer or an order confirmation in writing, (ii) are expressly designated as "guarantee" or "guarantee as to condition" (Beschaffenheitsgarantie), and (iii) expressly stipulate the obligations for PTC resulting from such guarantee.
6.7.    Warranty claims with regard to subscription licenses
6.7.1       PTC will provide and maintain the subscription licenses in a suitable condition for the contractual use ("fitness for contractual use"). The maintenance of the subscription licenses' fitness for contractual use will be provided by way of Support Services in accordance with the terms and conditions for Support Services as set out under http://support.ptc.com/support/services/support-policies/, such Support Services being included with the purchase of subscription licenses without additional fee. The obligation to maintain the Licensed Products does not include adjustments to changes in operating conditions or the IT environment, in particular to changes in hardware or operating systems or to new file formats.
6.7.2       In the event of an Error as defined in Schedule B affecting a Licensed Product's fitness for contractual use, PTC at its sole discretion may (a) replace the Licensed Product(s) that contains the Error or (b) repair the Error, provided that the notice of the Error is received by PTC promptly after discovery of such Error by Customer and Customer provides such additional information regarding the Error as PTC reasonably requests. If the repair (either by providing a bug fix, a workaround or otherwise) or replacement fails finally (after at least two attempts for the same Error from the side of PTC within reasonable periods of time), Customer shall be entitled, at Customer's choice, to  (a) a termination of the Licensed Product(s) containing the Error so that PTC provides a refund of the prepaid subscription fees for the remainder of the subscription term for the Licensed Product(s) containing the Error upon return of such Licensed Product(s) and any copies made thereof or (b) a reasonable reduction in the subscription fee of the respective Licensed Product(s). Replacements or repairs shall be made without acknowledgement of a legal obligation and shall not suspend the limitation period for warranty claims related to the Licensed Products.
6.7.3       PTC's liability for damages without fault (verschuldensunabhängige Haftung) for defects that existed upon PTC's acceptance of an order is excluded.
6.7.4   The Customer's right to terminate for deprivation of use in accordance with section 543 para. (2) sentence 1 no. 1 BGB (German Civil Code) shall be excluded, unless the repair or replacement is deemed to have finally failed.
6.7.5   The provisions set out in in Sections 6.3, 6.4 sentence 1, 6.5 and 6.6 apply.
6.7.6   Apart from claims for damages based on Errors that are subject to the limitation of liability as set forth in Section 8, the obligations provided for in this Section 6.7 shall be PTC's exclusive liability in case of warranty claims.

 Section 8 is hereby replaced by the following provisions:
8.    Limitation of Liability
8.1    Liability Categories. PTC shall be liable for damages, regardless of the legal grounds, only if: (i) PTC breaches a material contractual obligation (cardinal obligation) culpably (i.e., at least negligently), or (ii) the damage has been caused by gross negligence or wilfull intent on the part of PTC or (iii) PTC has assumed a guarantee.
8.2    Predictability. PTC's liability shall be limited to the typical, foreseeable damage: (i) if PTC breaches material contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) with slight negligence, or (ii) if employees or agents of PTC who are not officers or executive staff have breached other obligations by gross negligence, or (iii) if PTC has assumed a guarantee, unless such guarantee is expressly designated as guarantee as to condition (Beschaffenheitsgarantie).
8.3    Maximum Amount. In the cases of Section 8.2 (i) and (ii), PTC's liability shall be limited to a maximum amount of EURO 1,000,000 or, in case of purely financial losses, to a maximum amount of EURO 100,000.
8.4    Indirect Damages.  In the cases of Section 8.2, PTC shall not be liable for indirect damages, consequential damages or loss of profit.
8.5    Further Limitation of Liability. PTC will have no liability arising from any security incident or data loss that would have been prevented if Customer had implemented a security solution, devices or features (including "Patches", "Fixes" and Updates) for the Licensed Products provided or made available by PTC to Customer.
8.6    Liability Period.  Customer's claims for damages against PTC and/or PTC's affiliates, regardless of the legal grounds, shall expire at the latest one year from the time the Customer gains knowledge of the damage or, irrespective of this knowledge, at the latest two years after the damaging event.  For claims based on Errors of the Licensed Product(s), the warranty limitation period pursuant to Section 6.1 shall apply.
8.7    Mandatory Liability.  PTC's liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz), for injury of life, body and health, for fraudulent concealment of a defect or for the assumption of a guarantee as to condition (Beschaffenheitsgarantie) remains unaffected.
8.8    Employees.  Sections 8.1 to 8.7 shall also apply in the case of any claims for damages of Customer against employees or agents of PTC and/or PTC's affiliates.
8.9    Contributory Negligence.  In the event of a guarantee or liability claim against PTC any contributory fault of Customer must be taken into account accordingly, particularly in the event of inadequate fault notification or inadequate data securing.  It constitutes inadequate data securing if the client, among others, does not, by way of appropriate state of the art security measures, take precautions against external influences, e.g. computer viruses and other phenomena which could put individual data or an entire data stock at risk.
